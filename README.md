A four-dimensional game.

# Status

This currently only has a renderer. But it finally works! (mostly)

More to be done in the future.

## Todo

Remove remnants of 1D textures.

Improve performance. (fn view takes 100 to 130 ms on my computer, and that's with a simple example scene)

Fix the known-to-be-incorrect code.

More!
